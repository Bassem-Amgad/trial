			i don't know what to do <br>
			should i resign or continue <br>
			for my sake i must resign but for the team oh how disappointed they will be <br>
			the negative energy the overall mood and everything will make the team  don't have a chance to make anything <br>
			and i will be the one to blame and i know i will never forgive myself for that <br>
			so i will suffer in both cases but which one i can live with <br>
			the answer is obvious isn't it

			and then the million dollar question what is she to me are we just friends or sth more i really don't know  <br>

			i try to make her happy with all my powers and i can't stand seeing her upset <br>
			so the question remains unanswered hopefully whatever happens i won't lose her that is my biggest fear
