	<h1> Hi There </h1>
	<p> i don't know what to do
	should i resign or continue
	for my sake i must resign but for the team oh how disappointed they will be 
	the negative energy the overall mood and everything will make the team  don't have a chance to make anything
	and i will be the one to blame and i know i will never forgive myself for that
	so i will suffer in both cases but which one i can live with
	the answer is obvious isn't it
	</p>
	<p> and then the million dollar question what is she to me are we just friends or sth more i really don't know 
	i care about her so much and sometimes i must admit that i feel jealous on her from anyone else and 
	i try to make her happy with all my powers and i can't stand seeing her upset
	so the question remains unanswered hopefully whatever happens i won't lose her that is my biggest fear
	</p>
